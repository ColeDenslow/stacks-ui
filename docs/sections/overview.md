## Getting started


### Overriding Styles
Every component allows you to set a custom `className` prop for the outer-most element in a component. If you need to override styling within an application, you can set your own classNames for components and set your own overriding style in your application.

Stacks components have a low-level of specificity, with a few exceptions, which makes it fairly trivial to override styles.
